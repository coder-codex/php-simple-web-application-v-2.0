This repo contains the source code needed to develop a `simple` web application.

Enhancements from V 1.0 to V 2.0 :

The web app is now broken into small components.

Take a look at the code within the `index.php` file ...

Within the `index.php` file, the partial file known as `_html.php` is being called and the contents of the file are being loaded.

One the content within the `_html.php` file has been loaded, the partial files known as `_head.php` and `_body.php` are being called.

The content from the `_head.php` partial file gets loaded first.

The content from the `_body.php` partial file gets loaded next.

From within the `_head.php` partial file, we can see that the `_title.php` partial file gets called and the content of the file gets loaded.

We can see that the content has been stored within the `_body.php` partial file.

Clone the repo, study the source code, investigate the flow, learn the logic behind the code.

That's all, folks ...

Enjoy :)
